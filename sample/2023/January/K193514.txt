Dear Daya Ranamukhaarachchi:

We have reviewed your Section 510(k) premarket notification of intent to market the device referenced
above and have determined the device is substantially equivalent (for the indications for use stated in the
enclosure) to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the
enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance
with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) that do not require approval of a
premarket approval application (PMA). You may, therefore, market the device, subject to the general
controls provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that
some cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database
located at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm identifies combination
product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include requirements for annual registration,
listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and
adulteration. Please note: CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We
remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.

If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may be
subject to additional controls. Existing major regulations affecting your device can be found in the Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 800 to 898. In addition, FDA may publish further announcements
concerning your device in the Federal Register.

Please be advised that FDA's issuance of a substantial equivalence determination does not mean that FDA
has made a determination that your device complies with other requirements of the Act or any Federal
statutes and regulations administered by other Federal agencies. You must comply with all the Act's
requirements, including, but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR Part 807); labeling (21 CFR Part
801 and Part 809); medical device reporting (reporting of medical device-related adverse events) (21 CFR

Device Description

The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System is a fully automated urine analyzer that
provides a semi-quantitative or qualitative measurement for glucose, protein, bilirubin,
urobilinogen, pH, blood, ketones, nitrites, leukocytes, specific gravity, turbidity, and color
tone. The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System consists of AUTION MAX AX-4060
urine analyzer and AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips.

The AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips consist of a plastic strip containing 9 dry chemistry
reagent pads impregnated with chemical substances for the determination of the above
analytes in urine. These substances if present in urine leads to a chemical reaction that results
in a color change, which is measured by the AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer based
on spectrophotometry. In addition, three additional parameters, specific gravity, turbidity,
and color tone are directly measured based on reflectance refractometry, transmitted and
scattered light measurements.

Substantial Equivalence

AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System was developed as the successor to the predicate
device AUTION MAX AX-4030 Urinalysis System. The device uses the same intended use
claims as the predicate. The AX-4060 system utilizes the same principles and technology
and shares the identical 9EB test strips for measuring the same urine analytes in a semi-
quantitative or qualitative manner similar to the predicate device. Some important device
parts such as LED and Nozzle dispensing units were changed in the AX-4060 System due to
a change in manufacturing source and the device was optimized to generate similar
performance to the predicate device.

As described in the Performance Characteristics Section below, the verification and
validation (bench and clinical) testing demonstrated substantial equivalence for the AX-4060
System with AUTION Sticks 9EB test strips to the predicate device. Bench testing supports
that the AX-4060 System performs to meet specifications for precision, linearity, limits of
detection (LOD), sensitivity, carryover and interference. Additionally, software testing,
electrical safety testing and EMC testing also met performance criteria.

A list of similarities and differences between the proposed device and the predicate device is
provided in Table 2.

          Test Principle:

          The AUTION MAX AX-4060 urine analyzer measures analyte-specific test strips (AUTION
          Sticks 9EB) by dual-wavelength reflectance measurement (single wavelength for blood
          [BLD]). The AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System detects urine analytes based on
          chemical reaction on each test pad relative to the concentration of measured analytes present
          in the urine sample. The chemical reaction leading to the color change that occurs on each
          chemical test pad is listed below.

       Performance Characteristics

       Precision

       Precision study included repeatability and reproducibility testing in accordance with the
       CLSI standard EP5-A3. Three (3) levels of quality controls were used to attain results at
       negative, mid-level positive and high-positive analyte ranges. Two (2) levels of commercial
       controls were used to obtain the 3 levels by mixing as needed to obtain the highest and mid-
       level controls for testing of all the analyte ranks. Each analyte was tested using 4 operators
       on 3 devices combined with 3 lots of reagents for a minimum of 20 days. Results for each
       level are presented in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5.

   Method Comparison

   A method comparison study was conducted to evaluate the agreement of results from
   AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System to the FDA-cleared predicate device AUTION
   MAX AX-4030 Automated Urinalysis System. Testing was performed at two (2) clinical
   laboratories by using two (2) instruments and two (2) different lots of test strips. A total of
   1374 samples, consisting of 1333 natural patient samples and 41 spiked samples, were tested
   across the sites.

   The data from each site was combined and are presented in Table 6 showing percentages of
   Exact Match and within +/- 1 Color Block Match for all analytes on test strips. Non-test strip
   items for turbidity and color tone are in the same templates of Table 7 and Table 8 as the
   test strip analytes.

    Based on the interference testing, following limitations have been included in the labeling:

    1. Elevated hematuria (6.25 mg/dL Hb, approximately 2,156 RBC/μL) has been shown to cause falsely
       lowered Leukocyte readings and should be considered when interpreting Leukocyte results.
    2. Samples from patients taking methyl dopa may be falsely elevated for blood, negative to trace at 67
       mg/dL and negative to +1 at 225 mg/dL. Patients taking the maximum daily dose of methyl dopa may
       have approximately 210 mg/dL methyl dopa excreted in the urine.
    3. Patients taking SGLT2 or similar inhibitors may have extremely high urinary glucose values. Due to a
       hook effect on the glucose pad, if a patient’s urine glucose level is greater than 20,000 mg/dL, then
       falsely decreased glucose results may be obtained with the test.
    4. When acidic or alkaline compounds, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bicarbonate are taken internally
       for treatment or as supplements, they may affect urine pH.

** Not all of the substances tested for interference demonstrated no significant interference for all
analytes. For those substances that on initial screening were found to interfere with certain analytes,
dose-response testing was conducted to establish the concentration limit below which no significant
interference is expected. The results are given in Table 10 above.

Limits of Detection and Sensitivity

Limits of detection and Minimum detection sensitivity were determined based on three
instruments, and three reagent lots. Listed below in Table 11-14 are the quantitative
values indicating the lower limit of the rank in which 50% or more of the results are
falling into the specific rank.

Proposed Labeling

Labeling adequately communicates the device’s intended use, safety precautions and
directions for use. It satisfies 21 CFR Part 809.10 for in vitro diagnostic devices.

Conclusion

The information provided in this 510(k) premarket notification supports that the
AUTION MAX AX-4060 Urinalysis System is substantially equivalent to the AUTION
MAX AX-4030 Fully-Automated Urinalysis System.
